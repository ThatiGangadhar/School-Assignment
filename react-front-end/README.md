# Getting Started with Create React App

Description :
The goal of this project is to create an assignment system with the following four
key components: Students can complete their homework online, as we can infer that this is
a private school application. And there are also two types of users who can login to this
project: students and faculty.

Key Features:
● Faculty can create assignments for students.
● Students should attend a faculty-created assignment.
● Faculty should view the student's individual assignments.
● Students should view assignment results.

1. Faculty can create an assignment for students.

➔ Assignment Title
◆ Question 1
◆ Options : [MCQ] - Multi Choose Question
◆ Correct Answers

2. Students should attend a faculty-created assignment.

➔ View All Assignments
➔ View particular Assignment. (With Questions&Option)
➔ Attend the assignment.

*Students attended assignments to store user modules. And that should be Array of
Embedded.
3. Faculty should view the students' individual assignments.

➔ View All Students Assignments
➔ View a particular student's assignment. (With Questions,Option,StudentMark)

4. Students should view the assignment results.
➔ View student attended assignments.
➔ View particular attended assignment Result. (With
Questions,Option,SelectedAnswer&CorrectAnser).

Total modules included:
● User
● Assignment
*Important When students are present for the assignment, you shouldn't make any
changes to the assignment model.
*All requests should be recorded for postman collection.

Mark Reports from Students:
This project aims to provide a student mark report system with data visualization.

Types of Reports:
● Student Mark Wise reports.
● Student Subject Wise Mark reports.
● Student Class Wise Mark reports
*Important: Every chart report should also have data tables.


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
